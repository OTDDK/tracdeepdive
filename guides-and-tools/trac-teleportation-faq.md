# Teleportation Guide

## Instructions

1. Once you are ready, teleport your TRAC by visiting [**this**](https://teleport.origintrail.io/) **** website. Your TRAC will leave your wallet and be locked on the smart contract until further notice;
2. In order to receive OTP bounty, you need to first complete the short KYC on the link above;
3. Then, visit [**this**](https://teleport.origintrail.io/teleport-reward-claim) website and fill up the form. Make sure you use the same EVM (Ethereum) wallet you used to teleport TRAC, and use a self-custody substrate (Polkadot) wallet of your choice to obtain your OTP bounty. The bounty will be sent out shortly;
4. Next, you need to visit [**this**](https://parachain.origintrail.io/parachain-account-mapping) interface to map your EVM wallet to your substrate wallet in order to receive OTP-native TRAC once it's ready. The mapping is permanent so make sure you are using the right adresses to link;
5. And that's it. Now sit back and wait for OTP-native TRAC to be available!

## Teleport FAQ

**Many of you in the community have asked the following questions regarding TRAC teleportation, and I will try to answer them here in one place:**

#### **What does Teleporting TRAC mean exactly ?**

Teleporting TRAC simply means moving your ERC-20 TRAC from Ethereum blockchain to OriginTrail Parachain in order to be used on the DKG v6 for many different applications - check illustration [here](https://teleport.origintrail.io/).

There was an elaborate RFC that was discussed in details [here](https://github.com/OriginTrail/OT-RFC-repository/issues/16). The revised version of the RFC was approved and shown [here](https://medium.com/origintrail/ot-rfc-12-v2-teleporting-trac-to-the-origintrail-parachain-on-polkadot-de535a9d2693)

In summary, it was deemed risky to use a third-party bridge to bridge a large amount of our ERC-20 TRAC over to OT Parachain. In case of a bridge hack, such as the recent [Nomad bridge hack](https://mobile.twitter.com/i/events/1554556780239355905), we would risk losing all bridged TRAC assets forever.

That is why the team, alongside the community, decided to use **Teleportation** in order to safely move ERC-20 TRAC over to OT Parachain, using a smart contract that was thoroughly audited last year during [SFC staking](https://t.co/NYLru2Aqor).

#### **What are the benefits of Teleporting TRAC ?**

There are several benefits to teleporting TRAC over to OT Parachain.

* You receive a small OTP bounty for the amount of TRAC teleported. The bounty amount is shown at the bottom of the page [here](https://teleport.origintrail.io/).
* You can use OTP-native TRAC for staking/delegating, running nodes, publishing assets, keyword staking... Full list on the illustration [here](https://teleport.origintrail.io/)

#### **Teleportation step 4/4 shows “something went wrong, try again”. Did the transaction fail ?**

No, this is most likely a GUI error and not a transaction error. If you were able to confirm the transaction on Metamask and your TRAC is no longer in your wallet, it means the transaction was successful. If the Metamask transaction failed and your TRAC is still in your wallet. Try repeating the steps again after reopening your browser / using incognito mode.

You can verify the transaction by checking your Metamask history or using [this explorer](https://etherscan.io/) and inputting your wallet address to see where your TRAC currently is.

#### **What will happen to my TRAC if I don't teleport ?**

Nothing. TRAC will remain a ERC-20 Token. The Teleportation smart contract is only for those who want to use TRAC on the OT Parachain as soon as DKG v6 hits mainnet.

The team has given hints that in the future DKG v6 capabilities will also move to other blockchains. However, since there is no OTP incentives to use the DKG on other blockchains, we expect most future activities to remain on OT Parachain.

#### **Do I need to keep 1 OTP on my substrate (Polkadot) wallet to receive the OTP bounty for teleporting ?**

No. 1 OTP is only required if you do not fill up the KYC to receive the OTP bounty. If you choose not to KYC, then you will have to find other ways to get 1 OTP in order to use as gas fees to transact with your OTP-native TRAC once you receive it from the Teleportation.

#### **I have teleported my TRAC, where is my OTP-native TRAC now ?**

Please be patient. The team is working on the DKG v6 so it hits mainnet ASAP. As long as v6 isn't live, there is nothing you can do with OTP-native TRAC. Wait for an announcement on how to claim your OTP-native TRAC. The team has recently said the first 2 teleportations were successful so rest assured that they are on the right track.

#### **How long is the Teleportation lock up period and when will I be able to transact my TRAC ?**

Most details should be on the [OT-RFC-12 v2](https://medium.com/origintrail/ot-rfc-12-v2-teleporting-trac-to-the-origintrail-parachain-on-polkadot-de535a9d2693).

Soon after v6 goes live, an OTP-TRAC LP will be available on the OT Parachain to transact between TRAC and OTP.

The lock-up period is approximately 1 year, but I firmly believe LPs such as TRAC/USDT, TRAC/AUSD, OTP/USDT, OTP/AUSD would be available on Acala way before.

Do not quote me on this though as nothing is official :p

#### **Can I use my Ledger/Trezor to Teleport my TRAC ?**

Absolutely. I would go as far to say that is my recommended method of teleporting your TRAC to keep your funds safe.

OT Parachain is EVM compatible and Metamask will be used extensively (as is the case now).
