# OriginTrail's Marketing

This is a personal take on OriginTrail's marketing from BRX from the TG community and @otnoderunner on Twitter.

There's been a lot of talk about the team's marketing and I want to clarify a few things. I think most people saw it as a huge letdown when Ziga said they wouldn't put OriginTrail on big stadiums.

First, let me ask you this - are you into this project so we can show our logo on NBA or hockey stadiums ? Partnership with UFC ? Is this how you want our treasury to be spent ? If the answer is yes, you're either having wrong expectations of this project or there's a general misunderstanding somewhere.

One of the reasons why we see so many useless shitcoins in the top 100 is simple - Venture Capital fundings with pre-sales. Just follow the money, you'll see a lot of them have deep pockets, or deep connections, or pre-sales where VCs scoop up coins for cheap and want to keep their investment high.

The "problem" with OT is a lack of pre-sale to such Venture Capitals. The team behind OT also came straight from College, with very little connections to big funds. There's only one Venture Capital we can think of - AlphaSigmaFund. However, due to the nature of what Trace Labs is trying to build, it would be totally against OriginTrail as a project to have a huge Venture Cap pre-sale.

This is the chicken and egg dilemma, and a vicious cycle of low amount of VCs, low trading volume, price doesn't have much support, low general interest of speculators, hence we follow the general crypto market.

Now what's going to break this cycle ? To start a new cycle, we need a price increase purely driven by tokenomics. In other words, the best retail marketing tactic is having actual activity on the network and profitable nodes.

Favorable situations going forward:

* Polkadot is one of the most VC funded project in the space, having a parachain is a blessing
* Many locked-in partners who will be using the DKG (Swiss railways, BSI/SCAN/Aidtrust, OneAgrix, Ontochain, ...)
* V5 only had physical assets in the ODN, V6 will bring digital assets too (NFTs, DeFi)
* New partnerships with other parachains to look forward to
* OTP Community funds and governance / voting. We will be able to put marketing into our own hands with OTP funding

Reminder - Trace Labs is a for-profit organization behind the DKG. They are marketing their product to businesses to use their Trace Labs platforms and solutions. Trace Labs does not work for the community and does not owe us any marketing whatsoever. They have a valid interest to see TRAC rise (they do hold about 100M+ in TRAC funds in the treasury for the DKG's development) and they have built the project's tokenomics around that - network effects - the more the DKG is used, the more TRAC is valuable. The place where our interest is aligned with Trace Labs is a rising token price, but the way we go at it is totally different. Trace Labs require other businesses to adopt their solutions to remain solvent, and marketing funds will prioritize that. We retail investors want exposure to OriginTrail (TRAC) alone in any form possible to boost token price.

Going forward, we have the power to put marketing into our own hands with OTP. Eventually, we will have governance and voting powers to see how OTP is used, and one of the biggest gripe of the community is a lack of marketing. I have given an example of how we can use this OTP fund to raise awareness to OTP and TRAC.

Example: You have content creators who post the link of their marketing product and you have OTP holders who stakes on the marketing platform who gets to decide how much OTP each content creator gets for their work. Each content will be subject to several evaluations, such as their follower count, amount of views, content's overall quality, and so on.

This is one of many examples what this OTP Community funds can do. The team will keep marketing their product to developpers (Polkadot, parachains, Knowledge Graph Conference), they will keep on developping the DKG and they will keep onboarding new clients. Nothing we say will change Trace Lab's business model. If you want change, it's time we take matters into our own hands.

Currently, I don't believe it's the right time to market TRAC / OTP to new retail investors. As much as the team says we have TONS of adoption and MILLIONS of TGS, our network activity does not reflect that, YET. Without knowing what's brewing in the pipelines, new investors could see this as a red flag and they won't look back.

The team is doing what they can to increase that number and t increase the efficiency of the DKG (from v5 to v6, we are talking 500x performance). New investors will come when they see profitable nodes, and when they research to see if these nodes are profitable from just minting and fake adoption, they will find out they're actually holding pharma assets, railway assets, halal food assets and that will blow their mind. Retailers like to see yield %, they like to see network activity, when things are profitable, they will come in naturally, and if they don't, then more money for us node runners.

TRAC is not something easy to sell, it's very complex and to a certain point "boring", just like infrastructure TCP/IP stuff - it will become the core infrastructure of Web3 - but like Bob Metcalfe said it himself, it's something that's extremely interesting only to a select few due to the complexity. The only way to reach retail is through yield % backed by real tangible assets. Eventually, they will notice keyword staking, graph contracts, all kinds of stuff they've never seen before that will peak their curiosity, but it HAS to start with yield and good network numbers.

Tracdeepdive.info hasn't been updated for a while, but it is exactly the type of resource I am trying to build to make things easier to digest for new investors. It's still a big pile of mess right now and I have a lot to rearrange, and I will do it in due time. However, people who only think about quick money or staking yield won't bother reading that stuff, but if people see real profit, they'll start asking questions about the project and this is where they will find all info and external links.

TLDR;

The best marketing that will market itself is having high network activity and great node returns, and the only way to have great node return is through business to business adoption, Trace Labs is on it.

Bob likes money, Bob wants to invest in a token with high yield % staking and good potential, Bob sees DKG v6 otnode has good yield %, Bob makes money, but Bob wants money to be safe and not fake, Bob reads tracdeepdive and finds out about all these real assets, Bob is excite, Bob is a new tracer.

Update 2022-08-31 - Some new Knowledge Graph companies are starting to surface and try to turn web2 assets into web3, namely Golden, Scope, ESG Dao.

We just gotta keep in mind that there's no such thing as competition to OT, only potential collaboration. Web3 KG is something completely new and there could be trillions gazillions web2 assets turned into web3, room for a LOT of different parties.

What we've seen in the space so far working with KG and Web3 is companies like Golden, Scope, ESG Dao and they are all "starters", especially Scope and ESG Dao. What they all have in common is their business model - a subscription based model to access / publish data, with VCs in the back funding them and giving them connections to companies publishing in their KGs. They are what I would call a priorietary (centralized) "Web3" KG. I say "Web3" because users don't really own their data. If either one of these companies shut down their platform, you can say goodbye to your assets. They aren't as bad as web2 data silos since they do have interoperability, but everything revolves around their platform and their business model will make sure you stay with them and keep paying a sub.

What OT does on the other hand is completely separating Trace Labs from OriginTrail, they basically chose the most legit and hardest path to build a decentralized KG, the KG of all KGs that cannot just go offline unless all 2.2k+ nodes shut down at once.

If Trace Labs went the same way, Magnify would have a subscription model like this: FREE tier: Users can query up to 500 queries a month

Basic tier: 500+ queries 1000 publishes 100k api calls

Pro tier: 1000+ queries 5000 publishes 500k api calls

Rather than going to proprietary and subscription based route, Magnify will allow ANYONE to publish / query / make api calls infinitely as long as you have OTP / TRAC for each transaction. This is the main difference between the business models and how OT is still the one that's the most decentralized, transparent, neutral of all.
