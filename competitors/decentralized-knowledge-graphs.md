# Decentralized Knowledge Graphs

## OriginTrail and Golden Protocol

[Golden](https://golden.xyz/) is building a decentralized canonical knowledge graph, which combines a blockchain solution with a knowledge graph, much like OriginTrail.&#x20;

According to Golden, Golden started as a Web2 company in San Francisco on a mission to map all human knowledge. They raised 20M$ funds from leading VCs and investors. Since Fall 2021, they have been ramping up efforts to create a Web3 version of Golden to increase the speed that the knowledge graph can be built. Golden is building a permissionless, open source protocol that incentivizes the collection and verification of canonical knowledge, which it will offer to the public for free and charge commercial entities.

As of September 2022, Golden claims to have a whitepaper under review and to be made public soon. Golden Protocol is also currently on testnet with users able to submit triples, but not run nodes. This has me thinking that the Knowledge Graph is proprietary to Golden and therefore not decentralized as claimed. Compared to OriginTrail, 2500 nodes operating across the globe owned by users such as myself are the ones holding the ecosystem together.&#x20;

Among the 3 core values of OriginTrail, Golden seems to only miss on the neutrality of the network. According to their documentation, their canonical knowledge graph will be offered to the public free of charge, while commercial entities will be charged. All users of the OriginTrail Decentralized Network are treated the same. For example, publishes made from a user or a commercial entity will cost the same.&#x20;

Golden does not currently have a token for sale and have no ETA.&#x20;

## ESG DAO

ESG DAO revealed their project in August 2022, with the goal to build a radically transparent ESG system that serves the planet and people, not just companies. In other words, ESG DAO's objective is to restore public trust in businesses and the current system through a transparent OpenESG scoring system co-developped by scientists, NGO leaders, business leaders and government bodies, running as a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) for neutrality, transparency and inclusivess, and incentivizing engagement around ESG between businesses and consumers. Currently, ESG scores are underused and often times misreprensented and therefore, an OpenESG system could serve as a new global ESG standard, enabling public and private entities, Web3 projects, all industries and all regions to embed similar ESG metrics into their individual systems, permissionlessly.&#x20;

As of October 2022, there is no whitepaper nor token release, and very little detail is known about the technicalities of the openESG Decentralized Knowledge Graph.
