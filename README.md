#### _“OriginTrail is going to continue to rise because the Decentralized Knowledge Graph will give AI more and more data.”_

#### _“The weakness of OriginTrail is that it’s too complicated to explain to ordinary mortals. The technology appears a bit like middleware, which is a category that only tends to excite a handful of people, and I’m one of them”_ [_(source)_](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ethernet-creator-metcalfe-web3-will-have-all-kinds-of-network-effects/)\_\_

#### _“We have FINALLY worked out a neutral way to link all internal supply chain systems to drive data, analytics, and ultimately, visibility.”_ [_(source)_](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/courtney-soulsby-8a311512\_origintrail-decentralized-knowledge-graph-activity-6785842064576929792-uOsw)\_\_
