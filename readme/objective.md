# Objective

## **Solving Supply Chain Issues**

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/OTsupplychain.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

One of the earliest use cases of OriginTrail is being a supply chain protocol by addressing trust and transparency issues in global supply chain management. Current supply chains are plagued by the “one step down, one step up” traceability principle, preventing supply chain participants to verify each steps of the supply chain. OriginTrail is a unique protocol allowing multiple parties in complex supply chains to set up blockchain supported data sharing in multi-organizational environment. By verifying that participants meet specific conditions at each step of the supply chain, manufacturers, distributors, and consumers benefit from an [immutable ledger](https://academy.moralis.io/blog/taking-a-deep-look-at-dlt-distributed-ledger-technology?utm\_source=blog\&utm\_medium=post\&utm\_campaign=The%2520Ultimate%2520Guide%2520to%2520OriginTrail) of real-world data stored on the blockchain. By improving the integrity and traceability of a supply chain data and allowing for data exchange, the ODN also drives efficiencies for stakeholders, turning a supply chain expense into a revenue stream.&#x20;

> [I am really passionate about](https://youtu.be/8dbpQVdUQ-4?t=733) the fact that most of what supply chains do is really generate costs as opposed to generating revenue. So one of the things that we’ve been able to accomplish in the last 6 years of my career is launching a trustable platform that actually generates a return on investment from what would normally be considered a cost center in a supply chain. The fact that we can arrange this and have it be trustworthy is really attributable to the fact that we have a verifiable, trusted blockchain environment such as OriginTrail that allows us to share that data.

All supply chain data on a immutable ledger tells the story of the life cycle of a product. The history of each step including manufacturing, distribution and transportation becomes completely transparent to the end user.&#x20;

OriginTrail has been built to take advantage of globally recognized GS1 and W3C standards. This allows for efficient alignment of data from multiple sources, including both legacy systems and newer blockchain-powered systems. This data could be anything: tracking and tracing data, Internet-of-Things (IoT) data, descriptive attributes, etc. Once data is aligned, consensus checks to verify datasets from different stakeholders can take place; additionally, auditing via compliance organizations can be authorized automatically. Due to the sensitive nature of many supply chain and business use cases, the ODN is designed to provide a “zero-knowledge” method to prove data validity.

With all this in mind, the OriginTrail Decentralized Network overcomes a significant [barrier to centralized blockchain solutions](https://www.theregister.com/2018/10/30/ibm\_struggles\_to\_sign\_up\_shipping\_carriers\_to\_blockchain\_supply\_chain\_platform\_reports/): keeping trust between all parties on the network.

## **Solving data connectivity for Web3**

OriginTrail has since evolved from being a supply chain protocol to becoming the [world’s first Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG)](https://medium.com/origintrail/origintrail-multichain-decentralized-knowledge-graph-is-now-live-mainnet-launch-on-xdai-claiming-9ce037305508). Not only can OriginTrail help streamline supply chains through an open source protocol with the core values of **neutrality, inclusiveness** and **usability**, it can now allow valuable data to be exchanged in a permissionless, trusted and secure manner, while all parties retain sovereignty over ownership of their data. OriginTrail now allows for a scalable, trusted and secure way to share information between all network participants – it is the knowledge graph of all knowledge graphs (such as Google, Amazon, Facebook). The Decentralized Knowledge Graph is the portal for Web2 companies to join the Semantic Web. It is the backbone of data connectivity for Web3.

> The third generation of the Internet, popularly referred to as the **Web3**, offers an exciting opportunity to expand the way users interact with assets. Both assets, those anchored in the real world (cars, building, rare items such as an expensive bottle of whiskey, educational or vocational credentials, etc.) and those digitally native (NFTs representing digital art, gaming avatars or fungible tokens used for trading) are poised to change the way we **manage, protect and increase the value** of our wealth. Things we own are now **converging towards becoming Web3-grade assets** – assets made **discoverable, verifiable** and **valuable** using the Internet technology comprising both a **semantic layer** – knowledge graphs and **trust layer** – blockchain.
>
> Leveraging both the groundbreaking knowledge graph and blockchain technology, **OriginTrail is a neutral, inclusive ecosystem** striving to deliver **useful and foundational Internet technologies**. The **open source codebase** and **permissionless** nature of the established OriginTrail network layers drive transparency and laissez-faire type of a market incentives that underpin security, transparency and antifragility of the system. OriginTrail is thus becoming a core component of Web3 infrastructure, also ensuring **user asset sovereignty** as data representing assets can only be managed by asset owners.

In a recent [**interview with Dr. Bob Metcalfe**](https://twitter.com/ZDNet/status/1522268420724695047?s=20\&t=C1APYeT2P1tN27s4bHAP7g), the Father of Ethernet, at the Knowledge Graph Conference 2022, he was asked to rate OriginTrail’s chances of success&#x20;

> “The weakness of it is that it’s too complicated to explain” to ordinary mortals, said Metcalfe of the technology. The OriginTrail technology appears a bit like middleware, which is a category that only tends to excite a handful of people. “Yes, and I’m one of them,” said Dr. __ Metcalfe.

Despite the complexity of the tech, “What they are doing is right in line with where things are going.” More importantly, he took on the advisor role because he’s learning from what OriginTrail is doing, educating himself on what new forms of value there will be in the connectivity of Web3 assets.
