# Oracle

Oracle and OriginTrail partnered up back on Dec. 8th, 2018. As posted by Oracle [tweet](https://twitter.com/orclblockchain/status/1070678005763190784?lang=ar): “_**We are thrilled to partner w/@origin\_trail** to deliver secure and trusted data sharing for supply chains using #blockchain technology_.”

This solution is related to Automatic Dairy payments. What this is and how it functions can be seen in the video below, and more recently this [article](https://twitter.com/SmartAgriHubs/status/1458414682134523909) by SmartAgriHubs.

You can also watch Jens Lusebrink from Oracle [during the Liftoff event](https://youtu.be/UfRWKTKJOFU), where Dan Putrell from BSI was also present, explaining their involvement with Trace Labs creating solutions on the ODN.

Furthermore, one of the most important aspects of the entire OriginTrail ecosystem is the nOS, which stands for Network Operating System. nOS allows companies to on-ramp and market buy TRAC via any exchange without actually keeping any cryptocurrencies in their enterprise finances. TRAC is only utilized in the background, is directly purchased when needed, and used in nodes immediately (see [this writeup](https://medium.com/origintrail/the-network-operating-system-liquidity-provisioning-system-part-1-uniswap-integration-b38e7ae75e76) for details). _**As cryptocurrency never touches the company’s accounting books, it solves the problem of mainstream companies needing to purchase and hold cryptocurrency to use the protocol**_. Other more recent developments include [FireBlocks integration](https://twitter.com/origin\_trail/status/1355183928089440256?lang=en) of TRAC allowing for institutional buyers.
