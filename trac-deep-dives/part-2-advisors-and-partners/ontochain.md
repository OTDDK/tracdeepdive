[Ontochain](https://ontochain.ngi.eu/) is a new software ecosystem for trusted, traceable and transparent ontological knowledge on blockchain. It is a European project funded by the European Commission under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme (Call topic ICT-54) and it is part of the European Commission’s Next Generation Internet (NGI) initiative. This government funded initiative is an effort to develop technologies capable of defending the data security of European ventures and help ensure the internet remains a level playing field globally. OriginTrail is among the [selected projects](https://ontochain.ngi.eu/selected-projects) to help build this initiative. For a deeper dive into this topic, which can get quite technical, community member IOTB presented yet another Twitter thread.&#x20;
