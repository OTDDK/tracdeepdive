# Part 7: Partners

## **Look at Partnerships**

The team has released their bi-yearly report which highlights every single advancement made in the second half of 2021 which really complements the information here going forward. I strongly suggest going through the report first before reading the next sections.

### **Oracle**

Oracle and OriginTrail partnered up back on Dec. 8th, 2018. As posted by Oracle [tweet](https://twitter.com/orclblockchain/status/1070678005763190784?lang=ar): “_**We are thrilled to partner w/@origin\_trail** to deliver secure and trusted data sharing for supply chains using #blockchain technology_.”

This solution is related to Automatic Dairy payments. What this is and how it functions can be seen in the video below, and more recently this [article](https://twitter.com/SmartAgriHubs/status/1458414682134523909) by SmartAgriHubs.

You can also watch Jens Lusebrink from Oracle [during the Liftoff event](https://youtu.be/UfRWKTKJOFU), where Dan Putrell from BSI was also present, explaining their involvement with Trace Labs creating solutions on the ODN.

Furthermore, one of the most important aspects of the entire OriginTrail ecosystem is the nOS, which stands for Network Operating System. nOS allows companies to on-ramp and market buy TRAC via any exchange without actually keeping any cryptocurrencies in their enterprise finances. TRAC is only utilized in the background, is directly purchased when needed, and used in nodes immediately (see [this writeup](https://medium.com/origintrail/the-network-operating-system-liquidity-provisioning-system-part-1-uniswap-integration-b38e7ae75e76) for details). _**As cryptocurrency never touches the company’s accounting books, it solves the problem of mainstream companies needing to purchase and hold cryptocurrency to use the protocol**_. Other more recent developments include [FireBlocks integration](https://twitter.com/origin\_trail/status/1355183928089440256?lang=en) of TRAC allowing for institutional buyers.

### **SBB CFF FFS** (Swiss Federal Railways)

{% embed url="https://ifothebehodler.medium.com/swiss-federal-railways-adopts-gs1-epcis-origintrail-parts-tracking-solution-20c2058727ca" %}

During the Liftoff event, Dominik Halbeisen from SBB explained how they will use the ODN and why they partnered up OriginTrail to track train parts among other things. The entire presentation is available [here](https://youtu.be/Rzk-Z9lFaG0).

If you do not wish to spend 30 minutes on the video, you can follow this timestamped [link](https://youtu.be/Rzk-Z9lFaG0?t=168) and jump right into Dominik’s presentation.

The presentation ends with this [conclusion](https://youtu.be/Rzk-Z9lFaG0?t=845): _“We have found OriginTrail technology to be the right fit.”_

Brana Rakic, CTO of OriginTrail, was at the [GS1 Global Forum](https://twitter.com/origin\_trail/status/1366362319899525128?s=20) showcasing how 9 European Railways are utilizing OriginTrail. Unfortunately, the presentation is not available for public view and we could not get our hands on any recordings.

### **OneAgrix**

{% embed url="https://medium.com/origintrail/trace-labs-and-oneagrix-launch-blockchain-based-halal-certification-system-45a3bcfa404e" %}

OneAgrix and OriginTrail [partnered up back in early 2019](https://medium.com/origintrail/trace-labs-and-oneagrix-partner-up-to-enable-halal-product-traceability-on-the-blockchain-cde5dcb0efd1) with the goal to ensure and tackle the trust deficit in the Halal goods marketplace, enabling food safety and transparency. This brings tangible benefits to businesses and consumers in the USD 2.5 trillion global halal markets.

[Here](https://www.foodnavigator-asia.com/Article/2021/04/29/Tech-ambition-OneAgrix-has-dreams-of-being-the-first-halal-unicorn) is an article about the CEO of OneAgrix Diana Sabrain, who in 2015 established OneAgrix. I strongly recommend this article because Diana explains WHY and HOW this is made possible by the application of OriginTrail solutions. She is also extremely supportive of OriginTrail’s technology during the [Frictionless International Trade event](https://youtu.be/8dbpQVdUQ-4).

Note that John G. Keogh, Chairman of Trace Alliance, is also OneAgrix strategic advisor. Very recently, [Kevin Dean](https://www.halaltimes.com/oneagrix-appoints-kevin-dean-as-chief-technology-officer/), former GS1 Canada and global office, has joined OneAgrix as Chief Technology Officer.

### **InCube**

John G. Keogh revealed that [InCube](https://e-incube.ca/#/) has joined the OriginTrail [Trace Alliance](https://alliance.origintrail.io/members) and are [partnered with OriginTrail with John as the leading strategist](https://twitter.com/jgkeogh/status/1438133337273503751) behind the InCube Innovation Centre (IIC) for the Middle East. InCube has over 2100 customers and is focused on solving supply chain issues that go hand in hand with the solutions that OriginTrail is bringing to the table. The members John is presenting OriginTrail to represent [25+% of ](https://twitter.com/JGKeogh/status/1452903658606170115?s=20)[Jordanian GDP](https://twitter.com/JGKeogh/status/1452903658606170115?s=20).&#x20;

“THE IIC STRENGTHENS INCUBE’S POSITION AS THE MIDDLE EAST’S LEADING PROVIDER OF FOOD SAFETY-RELATED TRACEABILITY SERVICES, SUPPLY CHAIN TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATION PARTNER, AND SOLUTIONS PROVIDER FOR VARIOUS INDUSTRIES AND GOVERNMENTS.“

You can read more about the launch of IIC [here](https://e-incube.ca/#/NewsLetter/cnVrNjlO7D12YNKU0RoB).

[Here](https://twitter.com/JGKeogh/status/1438152505288916993?s=20), John also hints at a new source building solutions on the ODN, an anchor tenant partner of [Honeywell, who is also partnered with inCube](https://twitter.com/INCUBEFZCO/status/1452922835329064969?s=20). An anchor tenant is someone who leases large amounts of space and is the main source of traffic. In this case, they are leasing from InCube within the IIC! What John is hinting at here is anyone’s guess, but Honeywell is a [big player in several different industries](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/industries/overview).

For early 2022, John is expected to [travel](https://twitter.com/JGKeogh/status/1475939221701468162) with InCube to the Middle East to meet with multiple government agencies and industry players.&#x20;

### **Scientific and Academic Research**

[John G. Keogh](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=Keogh%20JG%5BAuthor%5D), MBA, MSc, [Abderahman Rejeb](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=Rejeb%20A%5BAuthor%5D), [Nida Khan](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=Khan%20N%5BAuthor%5D), [Kevin Dean](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=Dean%20K%5BAuthor%5D), MBA and [Karen J. Hand](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=Hand%20KJ%5BAuthor%5D), PhD have written the research papaer above highlighting the use case for blockchain and GSI standards on global food supply chains optimization.

In late 2021, John Keogh has also released another research paper about the Past, Present, and Future Research in the Semantic Web and Interoperability

### **Trace Alliance**

The [Trace Alliance](https://alliance.origintrail.io/) is a collaboration partnership hub connecting 100+ businesses, startups, academics, business leaders and technology vendors with supply chain subject matter experts. The collaborative effort of the alliance resolves different organisational challenges in supply chains management. The Alliance was formed to establish common ground for the prompt and effective utilisation of blockchain up to its full potential. The Trace Alliance allows companies to receive early access to developing technologies, facilitating new application deployment centered around the OriginTrail protocol.

Trace Alliance works like a marketplace that connects companies that want to use the protocol as part of their business solutions but don’t have the IT and blockchain resources, with companies that have Implementation capabilities. There are participation fees.&#x20;

Here is a list of a few partners:

* Deloitte
* Margento R\&D
* InCube
* EVRYTHNG
* Parity Tech, the team behind Polkadot
* Emurgo, the team behind Cardano
