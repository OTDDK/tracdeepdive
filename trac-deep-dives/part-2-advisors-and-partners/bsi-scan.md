The Supplier Compliance Audit Network (SCAN) is an association of importers that was formed to eliminate foreign factory audit fatigue associated with Supply Chain Security importing criteria within the US Customs Trade Partnership Against Terrorism program (CTPAT). SCAN importing members have combined annual sales of over USD 1.36 trillion and source from factories around the world. Today, SCAN has more than 21,300 factories in its database, with several hundred new audits conducted monthly. All of the audits are secured utilizing the OriginTrail Decentralized Network and comply with SCANâ€™s rigorous data privacy requirements. With flexible data permissions, the solution enables SCAN to share data with government agencies such as CTPAT.
