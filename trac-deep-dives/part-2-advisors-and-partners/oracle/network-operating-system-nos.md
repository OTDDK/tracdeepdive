nOS provides a single interface for connecting, rather than replacing, existing legacy IT systems with different blockchain ecosystems and the OriginTrail protocol. It is an enabler for enterprise use of decentralized technologies, fostering interoperability, and preventing vendor lock-in. nOS is available for Oracle users through an integration available in the Oracle Cloud Marketplace.
