# Part 1: Foundation

The **OriginTrail Decentralized Network (ODN)** is a neutral, open-source protocol enabling secure  peer-to-peer data sharing between companies and supply chains. It utilizes decentralized nodes and an off-chain technology stack to interface with legacy systems as well as other blockchains (permissioned and permissionless). OriginTrail allows businesses to improve interoperability among different IT systems by removing data silos, ensures data integrity, immutability and traceability by fingerprinting a cryptographic data hash of the data to a blockchain and facilitate trusted data exchange. The most recent implementations allows the transformation of all these data into Web3 assets, bringing the physical world (art, fashion, healthcare, education, supply chains) to the digital world (blockchain, DeFi, Metaverse, NFTs) and making them more discoverable, verifiable and valuable.

## **Core Values**

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/msg-1470710976-393.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The OriginTrail protocol has been built from the ground up with 3 core pillars:&#x20;

**Usability** — the technologies underpinning Web3 are fundamental, protocol level technologies. In order to ensure smooth onboarding of users, enterprises and developers, there needs to be a great focus on usability and user experience. OriginTrail today is being used within global enterprises and government bodies

**Inclusiveness** — Continuing to form partnerships with technological and business global leaders that can employ the OriginTrail ecosystem for their communities. Catering to the needs of leading global communities requires us to be making strides in designing technical infrastructure and business models that support the adoption of the OriginTrail in diverse business communities.

### **1. Neutrality**

OriginTrail's first core value ensures the inclusiveness of all parties, adoption of co-creation principles and collaboration with all other ecosystems. In order to maintain compatibility of all data from multiple parties, including both legacy IT systems and new digital systems such as blockchains, OriginTrail must adhere to the highest globally recognized standards such as GS1 and W3C, and remain open-source and decentralized. This prevents vendor lock-ins, ensures integrity and in return breaks data silos. The principle of neutrality is applied on all levels, including interoperability between any blockchains, integration with any legacy systems by applying open standards and allowing any users to review the open-source code.&#x20;

### **2. Usability**

In order to onboard users, enterprises and developers to the OriginTrail protocol, the network underpinning Web3 protocol level technologies must be efficient and user friendly. Trace Labs, the company behind OriginTrail, has developed many interface solutions used within [global enterprises and government bodies](https://origintrail.io/case-studies). The team has also built [Project Magnify](https://projectmagnify.io/), a DKG client for any users to publish assets directly into the ecosystem without the need to run a node. Improved usability of the ODN will only drive positive network effects to grow the entire ecosystem.&#x20;

### **3. Inclusiveness**

As the ecosystem grows, the team needs to continue forming partnerships with business global leaders and communities to cater to their needs. This will continue pushing the team to make new strides in designing technical infrastructures and business models that support the worldwide adoption of OriginTrail. This in turn will cycle back to the first core value of neutrality.

## **Standards**

#### **Open Standards (GS1 EPCIS/CBV and W3C integration)**

The entire global supply chain runs on standards developed by the [GS1](https://www.gs1.org/) organization. Systems to identify, capture, and share information among supply chain partners (including the ubiquitous bar code), were all developed over the past 45 years by GS1. [These standards](https://www.gs1.org/standards/epcis) allow for interoperability between different systems and supply chain architectures across the globe. Any blockchain-based solution to improve traceability should integrate with these legacy systems, and the OriginTrail protocol was designed from the ground up to do this.

The OriginTrail protocol [fully supports](http://docs.origintrail.io/en/latest/ODN-Functionalities/dataset-operations.html?highlight=w3c#supported-standards) the GS1 EPCIS 1.2 and CBV standards in the protocol data structure. This ensures full compliance and integration with legacy systems. In July 2020, TraceLabs [confirmed](https://medium.com/origintrail/origintrail-joins-the-gs1-global-epcis-cbv-2-0-a032b98d9437) that **they joined the 54 company working group** [**to develop**](https://medium.com/origintrail/origintrail-joins-the-gs1-global-epcis-cbv-2-0-a032b98d9437) **the next generation EPCIS/CBV 2.0 standards**. [This](https://www.zebra.com/us/en/blog/posts/2020/read-this-if-you-find-operational-visibility-to-be-expensive-and-therefore-elusive.html) article explains the implications of going from EPCIS 1.2 to EPCIS 2.0 and the importance of staying updated with current global standards. [Here](https://twitter.com/BranaRakic/status/1437778632236277776?s=20) is Brana Rakic, CTO and Founder of OT, commenting on this very upgrade ([_**Slide 1**_](https://postimg.cc/R6p2Lv0v)_**,**_ [_**Slide 2**_](https://postimg.cc/0K6Fth6D) _**&**_ [_**Slide 3**_](https://postimg.cc/1n3LF8sW) _**from the tweet**_). The upgrade from EPCIS 1.2 to EPCIS 2.0 will allow companies to view, access, share, and even monetize their own data in ways that were not possible before – a game-changer in the world of business, coupled with OT’s DKG, EPCIS 2.0 will bring enormous value to companies. This puts OriginTrail in an incredible position to shape next-generation intelligent supply chain interactions. Currently, a real-life example would be [Aidtrust](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/trace-labs-and-bsi-have-launched-aidtrust-301449290.html) using the GS1 and EPCIS 2.0 standards to provide supply chain visibility as noted [here](https://twitter.com/JureSkornik/status/1504786723968069664?s=20\&t=4BDvTDCVpJPMaccX7iI0vQ). More on that in part 3.

In August 2020, TraceLabs announced [an integration](https://medium.com/origintrail/gs1-digital-link-a-gateway-towards-trillions-of-digital-twins-8ce657122af1) of the ODN and the upcoming GS1 Digital Link standard. GS1 Digital Link is next in line creation by GS1, relying on the Decentralized Knowledge Graph, which is the ODN (OriginTrail Decentralized Network). You can watch Phil Archer explain this in this presentation [here](https://youtu.be/jJnahaZ9-Tc) (_If you don’t want to spend time listening to a full 8 minutes, then go to 5:20 where Phil points to the Decentralized Knowledge Graph, which is the ODN_). In other words, barcodes and product information stored on the ODN for seamless interoperability, interconnectivity, and decentralization, linking everything together.

OriginTrail/TraceLabs has been a member of GS1 since 2018, which gives them access to the development of supply chain standards and their implementation. OriginTrail/TraceLabs co-founder Žiga Drev was invited to speak at several local and global GS1 conferences, including the GS1 Global Forums in [2019](https://medium.com/origintrail/origintrail-takes-the-stage-at-the-gs1-global-forum-2019-d62320aa7268) and [2020](https://medium.com/origintrail/trace-labs-presents-fdm-project-at-gs1-global-forum-2020-c8e26af26a40). OriginTrail was also [featured in a 2018 GS1 position paper](https://www.gs1.org/articles/2463/gs1-releases-new-position-paper-future-blockchain-technology) on blockchain technology. GS1 members are intimately aware of the protocol through these endeavors.

The OriginTrail protocol also [supports](http://docs.origintrail.io/en/latest/ODN-Functionalities/dataset-operations.html?highlight=w3c#supported-standards) the Web of Things (W3C) recommended standard. This will ensure wide compatibility with IoT devices and has already been utilized for a number of European Union-wide use cases and pilots.

OriginTrail’s standards-based approach also caught the attention of the World Economic Forum (WEF), who detailed OriginTrail as one of the top blockchain-based supply chain solutions in their [2020 Blockchain Deployment Toolkit report.](https://widgets.weforum.org/blockchain-toolkit/step-two) They also published [an article](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/02/origintrail-blockchain-covid-supplies-repository) on OriginTrail’s Essential COVID-19 Supplies Repository as an effective use of blockchain technology.

Lastly, the German Federal Office for Information Security [praised OriginTrail as one of two future leaders](https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/BSI/Krypto/Blockchain\_Studie-374.html) in blockchain-assisted supply chain management.

In 2021 onward, OriginTrail has partnered with [BSI](https://www.bsigroup.com/), the British Standards Institution National Standards Body, who along with [Poseidon](https://www.poseidon.team/), the independent pharmaceutical logistics network, are bringing their joint resources and expertise together to develop and execute a Multi-mode Compliance and Standards (MMCS) program to help promote, monitor and assess adherence to the GDP (Good Distribution Practice) regulations that underpin global pharmaceutical logistics.

## **Blockchain Integrations**

TRAC remains a ERC-20 token that’s available on the Ethereum network. However, due to high network fees, most of the activity on TRAC moved on to gnosis chain, polygon chain and eventually Polkadot parachain. This was possible due to the token being interoperable and multichain. OriginTrail’s ecosystem can be part of any legacy blockchains and can easily adapt to an evolving market. Note that the total amount of token does not change. For instance, moving 1 TRAC from ETH to xDAI will result in removing 1 TRAC in circulation on the ETH blockchain and minting 1 new xTRAC on the xDAI blockchain.

### **OriginTrail Parachain**

As of November 2021, OriginTrail is participating in the Polkadot [parachain auctions](https://parachains.info/details/origintrail) with [first blocks](https://twitter.com/BranaRakic/status/1397213095823560713?s=20) already on the beta parachain testnet.

In the third [Twitter Space](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UpORSxZKVTGaa5fq9ZFvKlYVllu6-3Q7/edit?usp=sharing\&ouid=100070144854284008362\&rtpof=true\&sd=true) from OT team, Ziga, co-founder of OriginTrail, mentioned that:

_“OT has a formidable backing from the Polkadot ecosystem,  and that they will collaborate with at least one very important entity in Polkadot. Winning a parachain is one of ways to kick start network effects, but definitely not the only one._

_What we want to do is achieve a ‘double whammy’, not just the parachain, but something else which is going to help us win the parachain and essentially deliver a much, much greater network effect by exposing OriginTrail to the Polkadot ecosystem at least 2 different ways“_

_Even before the parachain, there’s going to be projects within the Polkadot ecosystem that are going to start implementing OriginTrail tech, and more of that will be revealed very soon_

_“One thing that is key for OriginTrail is to expose the DKG to the Polkadot ecosystem so builders can use the DKG for whatever they see as a best fit”_

For a better summary of what’s discussed in the Twitter Space, please visit [@IOTB’s stream of tweets](https://twitter.com/\_i\_o\_t\_b/status/1458213330015821825?s=20).

As of March 2022, OT has reiterated the importance of the DOT ecosystem collaboration and that they have been working endlessly on it. In April 2022, OT announced that they would run for the auction slot #17 or 18. In May 2022, OT successfully won auction slot #17 and expect their parachain to go live on June 4th, 2022.&#x20;

### **StarFleet Chain (SFC)**

Originally, the 6-month staking that occurred during February 2021 was supposed to lock-up 100M TRAC for the launch of OT’s own blockchain called Starfleet Chain, or SFC for short. This did not happen even though the team did imply that we would get the Polkadot integration regardless after SFC was up and running. Most community members believe the change of plans was for the better, see reasoning below :

* The team was already building SFC with ParityTech from the very beginning. Discussions have been had between ParityTech and TraceLabs when the decision was made to scrap standalone SFC for DOT integration instead. (_For those who aren’t familiar; TraceLabs are the devs behind OriginTrail, ParityTech are devs behind Polkadot)_.
* OriginTrail already had a functioning parachain on the Polkadot testnet. According to the [tweet that was posted](https://postimg.cc/mhGLPwHk) on Sept. 18th by OTs General Manager, Jurij Skornik, the chain had already produced 500k blocks and was “Polkadot Ready”. This was posted after his meetup with Gavin Wood of Polkadot in Miami.
* Decentralization! Having your own blockchain means you need validators. By running as a parachain on the DOT ecosystem, the projects get access to a lot of security benefits that the DOT ecosystem provides and also removing the potential vulnerabilities related to validators and collusion.
* Since OriginTrail is not a blockchain but rather an ecosystem, the DKG (Decentralized Knowledge Graph) will become available to the entire DOT ecosystem regardless of SFC or not.

In the [bi-yearly H2 2021 report](https://medium.com/origintrail/origintrail-bi-yearly-report-h2-2021-making-humanitys-most-important-assets-discoverable-af873702d807), OT has since called SFC a phase for overlaying the DKG onto the xDAI and MATIC blockchains and moved on to focus on DOT integration.

### **Polygon (MATIC) integration**

On August 26th 2021, OriginTrail conducted a [successful integration](https://postimg.cc/k62bDy6f) with Polygon (Matic).

As of November 2021, job numbers have been steady; around 20 jobs daily on MATIC and 180 on xDAI. There are a healthy amount of nodes running across both chains. This integration has proven to be very successful so far with zero downtime and contributed to the decentralization of data exchanges on the ODN. However, with the launch of OriginTrail Parachain, activity on the Polygon and Gnosis Network is expected to go down until further notice.
