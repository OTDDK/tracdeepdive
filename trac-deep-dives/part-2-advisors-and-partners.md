# Part 2: Advisors & Partners

## A **Look at Partnerships**

The team has released their bi-yearly report which highlights every single advancement made in the second half of 2021 which really complements the information here going forward. I strongly suggest going through the report first before reading the next sections.

## **British Standards Institution**

[BSI](https://www.bsigroup.com/) is just one of many serious standardization organizations that consult roughly 84,000 clients in 193 countries. They are creme de la creme within their segment and they consult both companies and governments to create solutions to mitigate risk, brand protection, and compliance, just to name a few. Right now, they rely heavily on the solutions made possible by OriginTrail.&#x20;

Read below:

BSI has [**partnered**](https://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/about-bsi/media-centre/press-releases/2019/january/bsi-partners-with-origintrail-to-develop-blockchain-enabled-solutions/) with OriginTrail exclusively to solve some of the major hurdles that their clients experience in supply chains. Back in December of 2020, OriginTrail held a 4-hour Liftoff event where BSI, Oracle, and SBB (Swiss Railways) were showcasing their work and solutions they were building utilizing the ODN.&#x20;

OriginTrail Liftoff Event
{% endembed %}

You can watch the Liftoff segment with Dan Putrell, Director of Innovations at BSI directly [here](https://youtu.be/Ss9pZkVsFpo). The solution being presented is for BSI’s [SCAN members](https://www.scanassociation.com/membership/our-members/) in the US, who represent 40% of ALL US imports each year. These companies must ensure that the products they import are from compliant factories outside of the US. Dan Putrell explains the entire process and its importance in the link attached above.

In June 2020, BSI released a detailed write-up on the use of Blockchain-based solutions to fight counterfeit products and false claims. Trace labs and the ODN (OriginTrail Decentralized Network) is mentioned as the solution throughout the article.

{% embed url="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Wy1QruYypPQE_4pSpfgs3_zpgu6tq73d/view" %}

Bono, from U2, who is a co-owner of a distillery called Monasterevin, hired BSI to consult them on a solution to ensure the authenticity of their products. You can read about the story [here](https://www.businesspost.ie/business/bono-whiskey-firm-brands-casks-with-blockchain-tokens-242764c7).&#x20;

{% embed url="https://twitter.com/origin_trail/status/1339606640887152642?s=20&t=i0ZYESkb9Q7epFHT6pATCw" %}

Dan also mentions a solution they are creating for the UK government, which we now know is [Trusted Bytes](https://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/about-bsi/media-centre/press-releases/2022/june/one-year-on-since-bsi-and-trace-labs-joined-the-innovate-uk-consortium-to-develop-new-digital-solutions-for-the-food-and-trade-industry/). This is a solution to ensure the digitization of the UK’s fresh produce and supply chains:

“BSI will leverage various open international best practice frameworks around supply chain data __ management, trust, and interoperability within the Trusted Bytes initiative. These include GS1/EPCIS, W3C DIDs, and verifiable credentials, ISO 44001 Collaborative Business Relationships, **and the open OriginTrail decentralized protocol stack (origintrail.io).**

“providing seamless real-time digital connectivity to supply chain operators. It will also enable a trusted data exchange that connects the supply chain with central government and other critical partners enhancing cross border transition, compliance and security.“

## **BSI Healthcare – AidTrust**

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUQFZOGpc5c" %}

Together with the British Standards Institution (BSI), Trace Labs, the core developers of the [OriginTrail](https://origintrail.io/), has launched AidTrust to bring trust, transparency, and reliability to the global pharmaceutical industry. Using the OriginTrail DKG and industry best practice, AidTrust ensures end-to-end traceability for donated medicines and vaccines whilst retaining data integrity and security.

{% embed url="https://origintrail.io/aidtrust-case-study.pdf" %}

“BSI, supported by strategic partner TraceLabs, implemented a data management hub based on the OriginTrail Decentralized Knowledge Graph (DKG) and underlying blockchains, powering a solution that enables product authentication, tracks patient utilization, and highlights any diversion or waste issues.” This case study is currently underway in India.

{% endhint %}

Preliminary conclusions are very positive and you can see BSI discussing the case study with their partners in the video below. This video is strongly recommended if you are interested in the application of OriginTrail in the supply chain mangement of the healthcare sector. Note that not a single member of the OriginTrail team is presenting in that video. You are seeing BSI members David Fairnie, Paul Raw and Georgios Ampartzidis from [WFH](https://www.wfh.org/) discussing the use case of OriginTrail.

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdjsJHVHnUs" %}

The World Federation of Hemophilia (WFH) is a Humanitarian Aid Program that processes donations to over 22,000 patients to date to allow them to cope with Hemophilia in daily life. All donations and shipments need to respect GDP making sure that donated products are safe to be used with maximum efficiency. This is where OriginTrail open source protocol comes in (precisely at [9:55](https://youtu.be/xdjsJHVHnUs?t=595) from the video above for more details).&#x20;

> “OriginTrail provides secure data exchange across supply chain networks, high level of integrity and trust, decentralized network that enables data scalability and flexibility, utilizes global standards, enables data operability and linked data that truly provides an end-to-end view. Its secured, structured and linked data then serves as a powerful base for a variety of business applications such as validation of certification, compliance checks, track and trace, etc.“

If you want a summary of this project, community member IOTB posted a great Twitter thread:

{% embed url="https://twitter.com/_i_o_t_b/status/1471160105743835149" %}

There are currently two global pharmaceutical companies and one NGO participating in the case study utilizing the BSI / Trace labs joint solution (see case study link above). Community member guinnessstache managed to TRAC down one of the big Pharma currently using the ODN.

{% embed url="https://twitter.com/guinnessstache/status/1471828191115452422" %}

BSI and Courtney Soulsby, Senior Development Director for Healthcare at BSI, were invited by Corvus Global Events to present their AidTrust solution on March 15th 2022 in an “[Exclusive Presentation](https://postimg.cc/jW8fXWwB)“. The attendees of this conference, Pharma Supply Chain & Security World 2022, were none other than [most Pharma giants of this world](https://postimg.cc/N2RwgHRn). Here are some highlights from Courtney Soulsby presenting on [Pharma Supply Chain & Security World 2022](https://corvusglobalevents.com/conference/pharma-supply-chain-security-world-2022)

## **BSI Healthcare – Multi-Mode Compliance and Standards Program (MMSC)**

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3IQKydFnPc" %}

BSI continues to surprise us with new development. This time around, we are introduced to some very important information regarding [BSI](https://www.bsigroup.com/en-GB/about-bsi/media-centre/press-releases/2021/june/bsi-and-poseidon-to-collaborate-on-global-multi-modal-good-distribution-practice-gdp-compliance-program-for-medicines-and-vaccines/) and [Poseidon](https://www.poseidon.team/news.htm). As mentioned above, BSI is using OriginTrail’s Decentralized Knowledge Graph exclusively as a solution to their supply chain management. We have showcased the case study on donated medicines and vaccines above, and now we are presented with this new collaboration with the objective of bringing greater quality, and certainty to the global logistic distribution of medicines and vaccines. The presentation above is well worth the watch not only for the information it contains but also for people to see the seriousness and professionalism presented. This presentation was held in June of 2021, and has now reached its completion phase, where BSI and Poseidon will be presenting the MMSC solution during a [conference called Pharma Making](https://twitter.com/makingpharma/status/1503702455737061382?s=21) on [April 26](https://postimg.cc/Z0s7wcyK) 2022. 90% of the attendees, global giants of pharma and pharma logistics, were very interested in the MMSC solution.&#x20;

Below is a small summary of the development:

> BSI and Poseidon will bring their joint resources and expertise together to develop and execute a Multi-modal Compliance and Standards (MMCS) program to help promote, monitor and assess adherence to the GDP (Good Distribution Practice) regulations that underpin global pharmaceutical logistics. The development of standards and the furtherance of assessment and training will form part of the program scope.
>
> According to Angus Metcalfe, BSI’s Managing Director, Global Healthcare: “The entire pharma-logistics industry stands to gain from this joined-up initiative which will reduce compliance costs, extract more value from logistics and lead to greater process and technical harmonization. It has the potential to be a ‘game-changer’ for raising standards”.

Dan Putrell, Director of Innovation at BSI, spoke about OriginTrail in an [interview with Interface Magazine](https://www.b2e-media.com/executiveinsights/bsi-breaking-tradition-through-technology):

> “BSI has become better and more digital over the last few years and accepted that we can’t do everything ourselves – we need to secure the right strategic partnerships,” he says. “**For example,** **blockchain is at the core** **of how we can bring trust to our client’s** supply chain through enhanced visibility and traceability. We’ve been executing practical use cases in supply chains and issuing digital certificates with our partner, Trace Labs (**Core developers of OriginTrail DKG**).  Transparency is trust, and with a growing deficit of supply chain and credential trust, blockchain technology remains an exciting part of our roadmap.”

## **Ontochain**

{% embed url="https://ontochain.ngi.eu/content/dkg" %}

[Ontochain](https://ontochain.ngi.eu/) is a new software ecosystem for trusted, traceable and transparent ontological knowledge on blockchain. It is a European project funded by the European Commission under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme (Call topic ICT-54) and it is part of the European Commission’s Next Generation Internet (NGI) initiative. This government funded initiative is an effort to develop technologies capable of defending the data security of European ventures and help ensure the internet remains a level playing field globally. OriginTrail is among the [selected projects](https://ontochain.ngi.eu/selected-projects) to help build this initiative. For a deeper dive into this topic, which can get quite technical, community member IOTB presented yet another Twitter thread.&#x20;

### **Oracle**

Oracle and OriginTrail partnered up back on Dec. 8th, 2018. As posted by Oracle [tweet](https://twitter.com/orclblockchain/status/1070678005763190784?lang=ar): “_**We are thrilled to partner w/@origin\_trail** to deliver secure and trusted data sharing for supply chains using #blockchain technology_.”

This solution is related to Automatic Dairy payments. What this is and how it functions can be seen in the video below, and more recently this [article](https://twitter.com/SmartAgriHubs/status/1458414682134523909) by SmartAgriHubs.

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-XucYs9FIM" %}

You can also watch Jens Lusebrink from Oracle [during the Liftoff event](https://youtu.be/UfRWKTKJOFU), where Dan Putrell from BSI was also present, explaining their involvement with Trace Labs creating solutions on the ODN.

Furthermore, one of the most important aspects of the entire OriginTrail ecosystem is the nOS, which stands for Network Operating System. nOS allows companies to on-ramp and market buy TRAC via any exchange without actually keeping any cryptocurrencies in their enterprise finances. TRAC is only utilized in the background, is directly purchased when needed, and used in nodes immediately (see [this writeup](https://medium.com/origintrail/the-network-operating-system-liquidity-provisioning-system-part-1-uniswap-integration-b38e7ae75e76) for details). _**As cryptocurrency never touches the company’s accounting books, it solves the problem of mainstream companies needing to purchase and hold cryptocurrency to use the protocol**_. Other more recent developments include [FireBlocks integration](https://twitter.com/origin\_trail/status/1355183928089440256?lang=en) of TRAC allowing for institutional buyers.

### **SBB CFF FFS** (Swiss Federal Railways)

{% embed url="https://ifothebehodler.medium.com/swiss-federal-railways-adopts-gs1-epcis-origintrail-parts-tracking-solution-20c2058727ca" %}

During the Liftoff event, Dominik Halbeisen from SBB explained how they will use the ODN and why they partnered up OriginTrail to track train parts among other things. The entire presentation is available [here](https://youtu.be/Rzk-Z9lFaG0).

If you do not wish to spend 30 minutes on the video, you can follow this timestamped [link](https://youtu.be/Rzk-Z9lFaG0?t=168) and jump right into Dominik’s presentation.

The presentation ends with this [conclusion](https://youtu.be/Rzk-Z9lFaG0?t=845): _“We have found OriginTrail technology to be the right fit.”_

Brana Rakic, CTO of OriginTrail, was at the [GS1 Global Forum](https://twitter.com/origin\_trail/status/1366362319899525128?s=20) showcasing how 9 European Railways are utilizing OriginTrail. Unfortunately, the presentation is not available for public view and we could not get our hands on any recordings.

### **OneAgrix**

{% embed url="https://medium.com/origintrail/trace-labs-and-oneagrix-launch-blockchain-based-halal-certification-system-45a3bcfa404e" %}

OneAgrix and OriginTrail [partnered up back in early 2019](https://medium.com/origintrail/trace-labs-and-oneagrix-partner-up-to-enable-halal-product-traceability-on-the-blockchain-cde5dcb0efd1) with the goal to ensure and tackle the trust deficit in the Halal goods marketplace, enabling food safety and transparency. This brings tangible benefits to businesses and consumers in the USD 2.5 trillion global halal markets.

[Here](https://www.foodnavigator-asia.com/Article/2021/04/29/Tech-ambition-OneAgrix-has-dreams-of-being-the-first-halal-unicorn) is an article about the CEO of OneAgrix Diana Sabrain, who in 2015 established OneAgrix. I strongly recommend this article because Diana explains WHY and HOW this is made possible by the application of OriginTrail solutions. She is also extremely supportive of OriginTrail’s technology during the [Frictionless International Trade event](https://youtu.be/8dbpQVdUQ-4).

Note that John G. Keogh, Chairman of Trace Alliance, is also OneAgrix strategic advisor. Very recently, [Kevin Dean](https://www.halaltimes.com/oneagrix-appoints-kevin-dean-as-chief-technology-officer/), former GS1 Canada and global office, has joined OneAgrix as Chief Technology Officer.

### **InCube**

John G. Keogh revealed that [InCube](https://e-incube.ca/#/) has joined the OriginTrail [Trace Alliance](https://alliance.origintrail.io/members) and are [partnered with OriginTrail with John as the leading strategist](https://twitter.com/jgkeogh/status/1438133337273503751) behind the InCube Innovation Centre (IIC) for the Middle East. InCube has over 2100 customers and is focused on solving supply chain issues that go hand in hand with the solutions that OriginTrail is bringing to the table. The members John is presenting OriginTrail to represent [25+% of ](https://twitter.com/JGKeogh/status/1452903658606170115?s=20)[Jordanian GDP](https://twitter.com/JGKeogh/status/1452903658606170115?s=20).&#x20;

“THE IIC STRENGTHENS INCUBE’S POSITION AS THE MIDDLE EAST’S LEADING PROVIDER OF FOOD SAFETY-RELATED TRACEABILITY SERVICES, SUPPLY CHAIN TECHNOLOGY INTEGRATION PARTNER, AND SOLUTIONS PROVIDER FOR VARIOUS INDUSTRIES AND GOVERNMENTS.“

You can read more about the launch of IIC [here](https://e-incube.ca/#/NewsLetter/cnVrNjlO7D12YNKU0RoB).

[Here](https://twitter.com/JGKeogh/status/1438152505288916993?s=20), John also hints at a new source building solutions on the ODN, an anchor tenant partner of [Honeywell, who is also partnered with inCube](https://twitter.com/INCUBEFZCO/status/1452922835329064969?s=20). An anchor tenant is someone who leases large amounts of space and is the main source of traffic. In this case, they are leasing from InCube within the IIC! What John is hinting at here is anyone’s guess, but Honeywell is a [big player in several different industries](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/industries/overview).

For early 2022, John is expected to [travel](https://twitter.com/JGKeogh/status/1475939221701468162) with InCube to the Middle East to meet with multiple government agencies and industry players.&#x20;

### **Trace Alliance**

The [Trace Alliance](https://alliance.origintrail.io/) is a collaboration partnership hub connecting 100+ businesses, startups, academics, business leaders and technology vendors with supply chain subject matter experts. The collaborative effort of the alliance resolves different organisational challenges in supply chains management. The Alliance was formed to establish common ground for the prompt and effective utilisation of blockchain up to its full potential. The Trace Alliance allows companies to receive early access to developing technologies, facilitating new application deployment centered around the OriginTrail protocol.

Trace Alliance works like a marketplace that connects companies that want to use the protocol as part of their business solutions but don’t have the IT and blockchain resources, with companies that have Implementation capabilities. There are participation fees.&#x20;

Here is a list of a few partners:

* Deloitte
* Margento R\&D
* InCube
* EVRYTHNG
* Parity Tech, the team behind Polkadot
* Emurgo, the team behind Cardano
