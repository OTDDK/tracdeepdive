# Part 4: Past Events

### **World Economic Forum 2022 Annual Meeting**

WEF annual meeting is scheduled for January 17th, 2022 in Davos-Klosters, and OriginTrail is confirmed to be part of the annual meeting, as mentionned by Ziga in the Christmas AMA linked [here](https://youtu.be/RdtE0Ic3iBY?t=3340).

This is not the first time we have seen WEF connecting with OriginTrail, see [here](https://twitter.com/origin\_trail/status/1305958004613951493?s=20) and [here](https://twitter.com/wef/status/1369754941355683842).

### **OriginTrail x Acala**

As of Nov. 19th, 2021, one day after Acala won the first Polkadot auction parachain ever, OriginTrail and Acala announced a [partnership](https://twitter.com/AcalaNetwork/status/1461686575566409730?s=20) by integrating the Decentralized Knowledge Graph on Acala, allowing physical and digital assets within the DKG to be queryable and indexable among other things. Branimir, co-Founder of OriginTrail and CTO, alongside Dan Reecer, Acala VP of Growth, discuss what a DKG is, and how Acala ecosystem developers will leverage it.

Once integrated, the TRAC token on the Acala blockchain could then be used as a base gas token or pay for any transactions, making the process seamless and much less complex for both implementation and handling. Using the substrate off chain worker pallet for OriginTrail, this integration will enable any Acala smart contracts or any applications built on top to query verifiably the Decentralized Knowledge Graph and also publish data or assets. The process will be very modular and the connection will be enabled out of the box. This integration is very powerful since it enables infrastructure to not only query a data or asset from the DKG, but also to do verifiable operations within a smart contract based on individual criterias.

In a nutshell, the integration goes in two ways. First, Acala will become another chain OriginTrail extends to, making the DKG accessible. Second, the rest of Polkadot’s ecosystem as well as anyone using Acala will get access to the DKG to query and publish data to it.

Another integration within this partnership was also highlighted by Dan Reecer. The Acala stable coin will be used within the OriginTrail ecosystem. This is a completely new idea that hasn’t been part of OriginTrail’s plan up until now, but having this possibility will allow for more building blocks and great ideas, enhancing network effects for all parties involved.

### **Frictionless International Trade**

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dbpQVdUQ-4" %}

OriginTrail’s **partners from BSi, OneAgrix, and SCAN/HomeDepot explain the importance of OTs solutions and how they utilize ODN.** This event is a must watch to hear all the real world use cases of OriginTrail straight from their partner’s mouths. It is impossible to extract all the information from these events as it would be too much to transcript everything that is being said, but for those who are short on time and don’t have time to watch, here are some transcripts from each of the representatives during this session:

**Ken McElroy**, Global Manager, Trade Risk & Export Compliance at Home Depot & Vice-Chair at [SCAN](https://www.scanassociation.com/membership/our-members/)

> [I am really passionate about](https://youtu.be/8dbpQVdUQ-4?t=733) the fact that most of what supply chains do is really generate costs as opposed to generating revenue. So one of the things that we’ve been able to accomplish in the last 6 years of my career is launching a trustable platform that actually generates a return on investment from what would normally be considered a cost center in a supply chain. The fact that we can arrange this and have it be trustworthy is really attributable to the fact that we have a verifiable, trusted blockchain environment that allows us to share that data.
>
> [Everybody wants their data protected](https://youtu.be/8dbpQVdUQ-4?t=1392), they want their supply chain as anonymous as it can be. What OriginTrail, BSi, and SCAN have accomplished is the ability to have competitors sharing compliance information on facilities that they are doing business with, without knowing who of their competitors are doing business with the same locations.
>
> [Where we’re trying ](https://youtu.be/8dbpQVdUQ-4?t=1464)[to take this going forward](https://youtu.be/8dbpQVdUQ-4?t=1464) is really to say we’re trying to take this to the point where we can create an end-to-end data flow verifiable trace of where a product starts in the supply chain and manufacture to where it lands at destination ultimately to the retail shelf so that anyone can take a verifiable UPC scannable detail and say ok this product came from point A to point B through this, this and this network or interchange without any tampering or whatever, so that’s really the innovation that Dan (_Purtell, Head of Innovation at BSi_) was highlighting before…The fact that we have the ability to link data from different organizations and put that together, that’s really the cutting edge perspective I think from a supply chain perspective in today’s market.
>
> [In the World Trade Organization (WTO)](https://youtu.be/8dbpQVdUQ-4?t=1691) there are data components that are uniformly exchanged between origin and destination with regard to transportation parameters. So, where we are trying to go first is to be able to potentially link the supply chain security details that the SCAN Association and partners are grabbing and then potentially marry those up with the transportation details that a regulatory agency wants with regard to maintaining the secure transition of goods from point A to point B.
>
> [The beauty of this technology](https://youtu.be/8dbpQVdUQ-4?t=2849) going forward is that the owners of the data own the permission for who can have access to it. So it’s a complete shift. That’s where I think the beauty of where we’re going with secure data exchanges is going to be going forward

### **Diana Sabrain** – OneAgrix, CEO

> [What OneAgrix does is](https://youtu.be/8dbpQVdUQ-4?t=817) we are the world’s largest halal and agricultural digital trade ecosystem. What we do is we have an end-to-end solution for cross-border trade and this would span from DNA traceability solutions all the way to matching solutions, payment, logistics. All in on one platform.
>
> [What we’ve been doing with OriginTrail](https://youtu.be/8dbpQVdUQ-4?t=841) since 2019 was to create an e-commerce environment where we could verify data agriculture to cart. What we are doing is also consolidating agricultural and halal data onto one platform and it allows us to create more transparency. The transparent supply chain is also about sustainability and we take this really seriously.
>
> [When we speak to procurement offices](https://youtu.be/8dbpQVdUQ-4?t=2337) from the halal sector, where 7-8% of procurement offices that purchase halal products are non-Muslims, they don’t know any better about halal certification data. Some of them would not be able to ascertain whether in terms of import laws, is the halal certification accredited So, you are now looking at a $2,5Tn industry being fragmented as one, but how is data traveling?… This is where we partnered with OriginTrail.
>
> [OriginTrail technology is amazing](https://youtu.be/8dbpQVdUQ-4?t=2958). Part of the technology right now that OriginTrail is using together with Oneagrix is to empower the African continent. [We do have a project going on with the government of Nigeria](https://halalfocus.net/nigeria-to-leverage-on-public-private-partnership-with-oneagrix-for-better-agriculture-and-halal-market-access-under-afcfta/) ([AfCFTA](https://www.salaamgateway.com/story/what-is-the-african-continental-free-trade-area-and-why-does-it-matter-to-the-islamic-economy?utm\_source=Salaam+Gateway+Weekly+Newsletters\&utm\_campaign=2ef78aad3e-EMAIL\_CAMPAIGN\_2019\_11\_24\_06\_09\_COPY\_01\&utm\_medium=email\&utm\_term=0\_c1e2a0613b-2ef78aad3e-229598204)). It’s called Nigeria feeds the world initiative, which will use OriginTrail as a layer of data transparency on the OneAgrix platform. We can not only use that data to do cross-border trade but at the same time to empower people. We’re talking about lowering poverty rates, we’re talking about giving economic empowerment to the continent. And you know Africa truly can feed itself, it will feed the world. It’s not just all about profits for us, the transparent supply chain is also about sustainability and we take this really seriously. OriginTrail will change the world.

### **Dan Purtell**, BSi Director of Innovation

> [Digital trust is very important to us](https://youtu.be/8dbpQVdUQ-4?t=678), OriginTrail and blockchain technology help us verify claims in a very immutable way. It’s a great strategic partnership with BSi and we only plan on growing it.
>
> [We need transparency within](https://youtu.be/8dbpQVdUQ-4?t=1053) the global supply chain, and I think that’s where we’ve really benefitted, as well as our clients, from the relationship that we have with OriginTrail, with the Decentralized Knowledge Graph, and everything that comes with it. What we’re co-creating together really provides a very powerful solution that’s growing very quickly

Again, there is plenty more being discussed during this event and I would highly recommend watching the entire thing.

## **EU Blockchain Summit**

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKgqGpZablw" %}

This was another event featuring Tomaz, co-founder of OriginTrail, alongside Dan Purtell from BSi and Ken McElroy from Home Depot and SCAN.

Most of the information concerning OriginTrail is in the [last hour of this event](https://youtu.be/KKgqGpZablw?t=25227), where Dan (BSi) and Ken (SCAN/Home Depot) are discussing OriginTrail’s solutions and the future of supply chains at the EU Blockchain Summit.

This session is filled with even more info than the previous one. I will post some of the transcripts, but this time without the exact timestamps. You will find all these quotations from Dan (_and Ken_) in the last hour of this event. Both Dan and Ken are again showcasing and explaining the solutions that they have created on the ODN which clients are using.

### **Dan Purtell**, BSi

> We have companies actually photoshopping reports and trying to convince some of the biggest retailers in the world such as Home Depot that they carried the credentials necessary for you to go ahead and make a purchase order, and it took investigations actually for us to be able to prove whether or not a factory had the credentials that they claimed to have. _We can instantly do that now with the SCAN blockchain solution powered by OriginTrail TraceLabs and it’s quickly becoming a best practice within our association._
>
> _I think what we have with the decentralized knowledge graph is proper plumbing to open up to other ecosystems down the road and gonna be quite easy to do that so the US Department of Homeland Security, Customs, and other associations we’re currently in discussions with where we can provide those blockchain components from a factory audit and share that openly to be a deeper trusted provider_.
>
> What we’ve been able to do with this is actually bring trust to these factory programs on very important matters of supply chain security, counter-terrorism programs, post 9/11 programs that date back to 2001.
>
> What it allows us to do is to neutrally and in a GS1 format go ahead and demonstrate who in the supply chain is certified or not, providing that digital trust. _Initially, it’s associated with the factory itself but in the future, it could be associated with products, could be associated with transparency of goods in the supply chain and I think that’s absolutely where we’re heading_. It avoids the common human errors that we see quite commonly there and really, I think what it did for SCAN is it demonstrated their ability to pioneer and to be visionary in a very untrusted world of supply chain and procurement. So we went forward with that. _Ken and I actually presented this in Washington DC and we believe it is a very good use case_.
>
> An AEO is an authorized economic operator, somebody that has been certified to trade facilitation financial integrity and you can also extend that to security. What this allows us to do is to demonstrate the credentials via blockchain but getting down to the next level not just whether a factory is certified but what is the factory putting in the supply chain? And what does that look like from a certification, from transparency, and from the trust perspective? _So, we have the AEO client which would be the different factories throughout the EU or globally, and then our customs risk analysts that are working in this database to understand what’s in the supply chain and what it looks like. And again, we’re using the decentralized knowledge graph to go ahead and take those different data silos to string those together to tell that story_.
>
> So, we do take AEO compliance data and we put that into the knowledge graph via a self-assessment. We’ve got documentation on corrective actions and the certifications and credentials that the actual factory or supplier has been certified to. We’re using the decentralized knowledge graph to take those different data silos to string those together. The geographical risk data we also use here in an authorized economic operator program that BSi is known for. It’s the largest supply chain risk management intelligence software on the globe. What we do is we take that certification and we look at the risk associated with compliance and we overlay that with geographical risk threat indicators that we track around the globe, including food safety scores.
>
> Primarily what this use case is about is food going from southern Europe into the United Kingdom. So we’re using it to track a couple of different things including risk. Inspection data goes into the graph as well as factory and warehouse audits, supplier audits, truck, trailer, container information, so we can provide that chain of custody and the traceability, and lastly some of the shipment level data. All of this goes into a solution called Connect Screen, this is a solution that’s the largest supply chain security and compliance software in the world and with that, we’re actually tracking different compliance indicators through there, so all of this goes in there. We crunch it to the knowledge graph, it’s blockchained, and it’s formatted. From a permissioned perspective, some of the customs agents would have access to this information or the AEO client would probably have a broader level of access to it.
>
> In understanding decentralized technology, knowledge graphs, decentralized knowledge graphs, it can be a bit complex. What I’m excited about is just how companies like the Home Depot, like the SCAN Association itself, are willing to go ahead and experiment.
>
> I think what we’ve demonstrated very clearly is practical applications to blockchain technology, to a decentralized knowledge graph. I mean this is real-world stuff we’re talking about here. Digital trust is the real world. These are solving modern-day problems. It’s not hype. it’s actually bringing a lot of trust in.
>
> I get to meet with a lot of big companies and I know this technology resonates.
>
> I think it’s helping us tell the trust story and we’re building these different ecosystems that are only going to get stronger as we connect them with other ecosystems, so I’d just like to thank Ken for being a wonderful partner in this and a big supporter and a visionary with that.
>
> I’d also like to thank my friends from OriginTrial TraceLabs for really making it easy. I think you’ve made a beautiful product for us. It’s working, and I only look forward to future use cases.

Dan Purtell also released a “teaser” during the event where he is disclosing that [BSi is ](https://youtu.be/KKgqGpZablw?t=29568)[in talks with a very large footwear company](https://youtu.be/KKgqGpZablw?t=29568). Below is the transcript:

> I’m having discussions right now with a very large footwear company and they would like a consumer to be able to go to their product, to scan something, and from that perspective be able to tell the story for that product, to be able to tell the story in terms of the fact that they’re socially responsible, there’s no child labor in that factory, that they’re certified to these different programs, that the factory uses renewable energy whatever % it may be, or recycled materials.
