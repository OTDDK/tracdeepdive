# Part 3: Blockchain

[**OriginTrail**](https://origintrail.io/) **** is **not a blockchain** – it is a **layer-2 agnostic protocol** that goes on top of blockchains and is utilizing blockchain for data immutability and decentralization. It is a multichain solution and can be integrated on top of any blockchain. Currently, OriginTrail’s decentralized protocol is operating on DOT, ETH, xDAI and MATIC.&#x20;

OriginTrail won the [**Polkadot Parachain slot #17**](https://parachains.info/details/origintrail) on May 2022, and has been working closely with the [Parity Technology team who also joined the Trace Alliance](https://medium.com/origintrail/parity-technologies-joins-trace-alliances-working-group-on-decentralization-and-tokenomics-8eaad2843ca7). [DOT integrations](https://medium.com/origintrail/trace-labs-origintrail-core-developers-selected-for-paritys-substrate-builders-program-e00a9b65bee) have been worked by both parties for over a year. Once the new OriginTrail protocol goes live, we expect most network activity to migrate over to the OriginTrail Parachain, a blockchain tailored to the DKG, which uses the layer-1 token OTP as a gas and incentivisation token.&#x20;
