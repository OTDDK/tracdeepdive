[Matthew Williams](https://www.instagram.com/matthewmwilliams/?hl=en), the fashion designer behind the 1017 ALYX 9SM brand, wanted to bring greater transparency to the label’s supply chain and cultivate deeper connections with the consumers. By scanning the unique digital code on an item's label with their smartphone, consumers can view the garment’s journey and track it all the way from the factory to the point-of-sale. This raises the bar on the promise of transparency and sustainability in the apparel industry.
