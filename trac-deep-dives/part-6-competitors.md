# Part 6: Competitors

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/OTvsothers.jpg" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In this section, I will briefly touch upon every project that share a few similar aspects with OriginTrail. Despite what is shown on the illustration above, OriginTrail does not have any competitors. As one of the core values of neutrality dictates, the ODN is built with the adoption of co-creation principles and collaboration with all other ecosystems in mind. The Decentralized Knowledge Graph can be built on top of any projects, allowing each entity to break data silos and make use of global standards.&#x20;

## Supply Chain Collaborators

Crypto media tends to mix Vechain, Te-Foods, WTC, Ambrosus, OriginTrail and Morpheus together calling them supply chain projects. That assumption is false. Understandably, very few investors or media outlets have extended knowledge of the backend system operations which are basically complex ERP systems that supply chains rely on (Oracle NetSuite, SAP, Microsoft Dynamics, and plethora of other systems), and which allow companies to do their day-to-day operations. In other words, most of these projects are not supply chain solutions as they only scrape the surface layer of the supply chain ecosystem. Most of these are traceability projects, promising to verify that consumers are getting products that producers say they are. In no way are the majority of these projects solving the main issues that have been plaguing the supply chain industry for a very long time, which is the lack of seamless and decentralized interoperability and interconnectivity of siloed legacy systems and storages, where all systems are communicating effortlessly, abiding by the strict rules of global standards without the need to create complex customizations each time you are dealing with a system you haven’t dealt with before.&#x20;

Here is an example:

If company A runs system X, company B system Y, and company C system Z, they don’t need to create 6 to 9 different customizations to whatever ERP system they are using in order to communicate with each other. With the OriginTrail protocol, each company uploads their data via the ODN (OriginTrail Decentralized Network) in order to share whatever needs to be shared, keeping their costs down and avoiding expensive expansions into other systems that their clients/vendors/suppliers may demand.

## OriginTrail vs The Graph

## OriginTrail vs Golden Protocol

[Golden](https://golden.xyz/) is building a decentralized canonical knowledge graph, which combines a blockchain solution with a knowledge graph, much like OriginTrail.&#x20;

According to Golden, Golden started as a Web2 company in San Francisco on a mission to map all human knowledge. They raised 20M$ funds from leading VCs and investors. Since Fall 2021, they have been ramping up efforts to create a Web3 version of Golden to increase the speed that the knowledge graph can be built. Golden is building a permissionless, open source protocol that incentivizes the collection and verification of canonical knowledge, which it will offer to the public for free and charge commercial entities.

As of September 2022, Golden claims to have a whitepaper under review and to be made public soon. Golden Protocol is also currently on testnet with users able to submit triples, but not run nodes. This has me thinking that the Knowledge Graph is proprietary to Golden and therefore not decentralized as claimed. Compared to OriginTrail, 2500 nodes operating across the globe owned by users such as myself are the ones holding the ecosystem together.&#x20;

Among the 3 core values of OriginTrail, Golden seems to only miss on the neutrality of the network. According to their documentation, their canonical knowledge graph will be offered to the public free of charge, while commercial entities will be charged. All users of the OriginTrail Decentralized Network are treated the same. For example, publishes made from a user or a commercial entity will cost the same.&#x20;

Golden does not currently have a token for sale and have no ETA.&#x20;
